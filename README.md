# Practice
This is a website under development, for educational purposes, which aims to share Front End tutorials. You will usually find links to video lessons, initial and final project files under each item listed. All credit is given to their respective creators. As you move forward in your learning process, I recommend that you try to do one of the projects yourself from start to finish, with just the initial files, and then use the finished project file to compare the results and clear your doubts. I am a student just like you and my goal is that one day this page becomes a complete website to help other beginners like me, I wish you success in your studies.
